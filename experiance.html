    <h2>Work Experience & Skills</h2>

    <h3>Teaching Assistant</h3>
    <h4>University of Alberta | September 2025 – Present </h4>
    <p>As a Teaching Assistant for CMPUT 175: Introduction to the Foundations of Computation II (Python), I support over 130 students by leading labs and office hours. I help explain core programming concepts, guide students through problem-solving, and provide detailed feedback on assignments. I love creating a supportive learning space where students feel comfortable asking questions and growing their confidence in coding.</p>

    <h3>Community Caretaker</h3>
    <h4>St. Joseph’s College | September 2025 – Present</h4>
    <p>As a Community Caretaker, I help make St. Joseph’s College feel like home for everyone. I plan and host community events, mediate and resolve resident concerns, and encourage collaboration and inclusivity across the building. Whether it’s organizing a group study session or a casual coffee night, I aim to build a welcoming and connected space for all residents.</p>
