        <h3>Feelin</h3>
        <p>Fellin is a data-driven Android application developed as part of my CMPUT 301 course. It allows users to share their moods through a visually engaging and interactive interface. Built with Java, XML, and Firebase (NoSQL), the app enables users to log and visualize their emotional data on maps while maintaining complete privacy and control over what they share.
            I designed and refined the app’s UI/UX using XML to create an intuitive and minimal experience. On the backend, I implemented data cleaning and extraction pipelines to manage mood entries efficiently, optimized real-time data retrieval using Firebase, and visualized user insights on interactive mood maps. The project emphasized clean architecture, privacy-aware design, and a user-centered experience.</p>

        <h3>Head Navigation Chrome Extension</h3>
        <p>At HackED 2025, my team and I designed and developed a computer-vision–powered Chrome extension that enables hands-free scrolling and navigation through real-time head tracking. Built with JavaScript, FaceAPI.js, HTML, and CSS, the project leverages facial landmark detection to translate subtle head movements into smooth, responsive page interactions.
            We conducted data calibration and model testing to fine-tune motion sensitivity, ensuring precise and comfortable control for users. The result was an innovative accessibility-focused solution recognized as the DivE Category Winner for its creativity, impact, and technical execution.</p>
